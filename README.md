# Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise
## Overview
In this exercise we show how you can track the MIT public bus route in real time with APIs and Google Maps.

## How To Run
Just open the index.html file and the map will load by itself. It will say that the page can't load Google Maps correctly, but it will work just fine so just ignore that message.
Then you can observe how the markers move, meanwhile the red markers represent the buses going towards Harvard and the blue markers represent the buses coming back in their route from Harvard.

## Roadmap to future improvements
After several people see this page maybe the API won't work anymore since it would go over the limit that it has so that can cause a problem for the future. I do not plan to fix it unless necessary since the user can get their own APIs and use them instead of the ones given in the code.
